    <h1>Lumiere, Nicholas</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. I have played chess since I was 5. 
        I collect very cheap sunglasses I get for free.</p>
    <p>I decided to study computer science because I felt that it would give me the most readily-acessisible 
        and relevant tools to build cool things. As an added bonus many tech companies have free sunglasses.</p>
